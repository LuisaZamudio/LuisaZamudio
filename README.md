- Hi, I’m @LuisaZamudio

I have a BSc in Physics from the Autonomous University of Baja California (Universidad Autonoma de Baja California UABC)
Currently I’m a post-bacc researcher for the UNAM Astronomy Institute, campus Ensenada. My research advisor is Dr. Jesus Hernandez. 
My main interest centers in the study of pre-main-sequence stars, mainly T-Tauri stars and their circumstellar/protoplanetary disks, 
from which future planetary systems can develop. Much of my work has been focused in the spectroscopic study and characterization of 
T-Tauri stars using astrometric and mid-infrared photometric data.

- I’m currently learning how to use git and GitHub and would appreciate any tips regarding my introductory projects.
